Projects
• AIvaluation github.com/ualUsham/AIvaluation
– This is a Web App that allows users to prepare for interviews based on their resume. Users have to register and upload
their resume. Gemini AI is used to analyse the resume and ask 10 relevant questions. Based on the responses, AI will grade
the candidate’skill on a scale of 10. Firebase Auth, Firestore, Reactjs, Expressjs,etc are implemented.
• Telegram bot with Gemini AI for response & image analysis github.com/ualUsham/ualBot
– This Node.js application integrates a Telegram bot with Google Gemini AI and MongoDB Atlas Cloud server to provide
dynamic user interactions. It performs 4 main tasks i.e Register users to Mongodb cloud database, Process user-messages
with AI-generated responses, Analyzes user-uploaded Images with summary & Google searches with summarized results.
• Habit Tracker React App github.com/ualUsham/Heinabi-habit-tracker
– Heinabi is a React-based habit tracking app where users can create, manage, and track habits effortlessly. It features
an interactive FullCalendar for visual progress tracking and a responsive Bootstrap design for a modern user experience.
Deployed on Netlify, it supports continuous deployment with Git for instant updates.
• Amazon AI Assisted FAQ github.com/ualUsham/Amazon_AI_Assisted_FAQ
– This is a chatbot which helps customers to get AI assistance while shopping on the Amazon website. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is implemented using Google’s LLM Gemini. Frameworks like LangChain, Hugging Face, Streamlit, etc.,
were used during this project.
• Skin Disease Treatment Recommendation github.com/ualUsham/Skin_Disease_Treatment_Recommendation
– Transfer Learning using the MobileNetV2 model is used to build a robust system capable of accurately predicting skin
diseases based on uploaded images. With a simple photo upload, users can get potential diagnoses, understand their
symptoms, and receive initial treatment recommendations. Torch and torchvision were the main libraries used, and Gradio
was implemented for the interface.
